# Clever trick to add history support and tab completion to cPython.
# This was stolen from a fellow ubuntero's blog and extended to add
# more error checking along with the ability to be ran system-wide.
#
# Save as /etc/pythonrc and put 'export PYTHONSTARTUP=/etc/pythonrc' in
# /etc/bash.bashrc. This makes the functionality available system-wide.
